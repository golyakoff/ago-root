# Roadmap

Stages are ordered so that the project is demonstrable early and the hardest, most interview-relevant
work (Stages 4, 6, 7, 9) happens on a stable skeleton rather than during it.

Each stage lists its **goal**, **deliverables**, and **done when** — the last one is what a session
checks itself against before calling the stage finished. Stages are not time-boxed; they are
scope-boxed.

---

## Stage 0 — Foundation

**Goal:** six repositories that build, publish and consume each other, plus the rules that keep them
honest — with no business code in them yet.

Deliverables:
- Repositories created and structured per `conventions/naming-and-structure.md`; junctions per
  `runbooks/workspace.md`.
- `ago-platform`: `Ago.Platform.Kernel` (`Result<T>`, `Error`, id primitives, `IClock`,
  `IIdGenerator` producing uuid v7) and `Ago.Platform.Hosting` with the `IProductModule` contract.
  `dotnet pack` into a local file feed; SemVer from the first version.
- `ago-chat`: solution consuming those packages through `nuget.config`, the documented
  `ProjectReference` dev override, and an empty `Ago.Chat.Module`.
- `Ago.Chat.Architecture.Tests` with the rules from `architecture/clean-architecture.md` — written
  **first**, and demonstrably failing when deliberately violated.
- `.editorconfig`, nullable, warnings-as-errors, central package management, in both backend repos.
- `ago-deploy`: docker-compose (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis, MinIO) and a Kustomize base plus `local`
  overlay for the Docker Desktop cluster.
- CI per repository: build, test, arch test on every branch; platform additionally packs and publishes.

**Done when:** `ago-chat` builds against a *published* platform package version (not a project
reference), `dotnet test` is green, `kubectl apply -k` brings up the infrastructure, and an
intentional layering violation fails CI.

---

## Stage 1 — One vertical slice, end to end

**Goal:** a visitor's message reaches an operator. Nothing scalable yet — the shape first.

Deliverables:
- Domain: `Site`, `Visitor`, `Operator`, `Conversation`, `Message` with real invariants.
- Use cases: `StartConversation`, `SendMessage`, `GetConversationHistory` (keyset).
- Postgres persistence with EF Core migrations; Dapper read store for history.
- `Ago.Chat.Api` with the two hubs, visitor token issuance, minimal auth for operators. "Minimal"
  means identity only, no authorization model yet - `architecture/authorization.md` is the open
  question this slice will make impossible to keep deferring.
- `IProductModule` and the host loading it — the platform/product seam exists from the first slice.
- Tests at every level, including the DST-boundary time test.

**Done when:** two browser tabs talk to each other through one API instance, history survives a
reload, and the whole path has tests that would fail if the layering were bypassed.

---

## Stage 2 — Durability: outbox, consumers, idempotency

**Goal:** an acknowledged message is never lost.

Deliverables:
- `outbox` and `inbox` tables; write-in-one-transaction discipline in every handler.
- `Ago.Chat.Worker` host, outbox dispatcher with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and poll-plus-notify.
- RabbitMQ adapter implementing the port from `adr/0006`, including retry/DLQ.
- Idempotent consumers; `messages` partitioning introduced here.
- Integration tests with Testcontainers, including "kill the dispatcher mid-batch".

**Done when:** the broker can be stopped and started under load with zero acknowledged-but-lost
messages, and duplicate delivery provably creates no duplicate rows.

---

## Stage 3 — Scale-out realtime

**Goal:** more than one Api replica, with no sticky sessions.

Deliverables:
- Redis connection registry, presence, heartbeats, TTLs (`adr/0007`, `adr/0009`).
- Targeted fan-out through the broker; per-node delivery consumers.
- Reconnect-and-resume protocol (`sequence`-based), jittered backoff in the client.
- Caching layer: `ICache` port, cache-aside for site config, stampede protection, TTL jitter,
  event-driven invalidation, `IRateLimiter` token bucket.
- Graceful shutdown: drain, readiness-vs-liveness split, `preStop`.

**Done when:** three Api replicas serve one conversation correctly, a rolling restart under load
costs only reconnects, and `FLUSHALL` on Redis degrades without corrupting anything.

---

## Stage 4 — Assignment engine (the concurrency centrepiece)

**Goal:** the contended path, done properly and provably.

Deliverables:
- Waiting queue, capacity model, assignment loop with `SKIP LOCKED` batch claiming.
- Optimistic-concurrency capacity enforcement; retries treated as normal outcomes.
- The Redis distributed-lock alternative behind the same port, for comparison.
- Release-on-operator-disconnect with a grace period.
- In-process pipeline: bounded channels, batch writer, `ConversationSequencer`.
- `Ago.Chat.Concurrency.Tests`: ordering, capacity, idempotency, shutdown, backpressure.

**Done when:** under sustained contention no operator ever exceeds capacity, no conversation is
double-assigned, ordering holds, and the stress tests pass repeatedly rather than usually.

---

## Stage 5 — The two frontends and attachments

**Goal:** something a person can actually use, and the file path.

Deliverables:
- Widget: TypeScript, Shadow DOM, small bundle, reconnect logic, `data-site` bootstrap, a demo host page.
- Operator console (framework decided here — React or Angular, recorded as an ADR). Console login is
  where operator authentication stops being deferrable - `architecture/authorization.md` records the
  working direction (OIDC) and the still-open authorization-model decision.
- Attachments end to end: presign, direct upload, verify, thumbnail consumer, orphan sweeper
  (`architecture/file-storage.md`).
- Per-site CORS from the database; per-site and per-visitor rate limits enforced.

**Done when:** a plain HTML page with one script tag holds a real conversation with file exchange
against the local cluster.

---

## Stage 6 — Outbound webhooks and resilience

**Goal:** the boundary with someone else's unreliable system, contained properly.

Deliverables:
- `Ago.Chat.Webhooks` host: tenant endpoint registration, signed deliveries, delivery log.
- `Ago.Platform.Resilience`: timeout, jittered retry, circuit breaker and bulkhead policies behind
  ports — configured per call site, never applied globally by reflex.
- Per-endpoint circuit breaker, per-tenant concurrency cap, layered timeouts, bounded retries, DLQ
  with the full request/response context (`architecture/resilience.md`, `adr/0013`).
- A fake CRM test harness with three personalities: hangs, 5xxs, disappeared.
- Tenant-visible delivery history, because a webhook system without one is unsupportable.

**Done when:** with a CRM that hangs for 30 seconds on every call, message ingest and delivery stay
inside their `nfr.md` targets — proven under load, not asserted. The breaker opens, the bulkhead
holds, and nothing retries in a hot loop.

---

## Stage 7 — Observability and load

**Goal:** turn every claim in `architecture/nfr.md` into a number.

Deliverables:
- OpenTelemetry traces spanning hub → handler → DB → outbox → broker → consumer → delivery.
- Metrics: RED per endpoint/hub/consumer, queue depth, channel occupancy, batch histogram, outbox
  lag, DLQ count, cache hit ratio, connections per node, assignment conflicts.
- Grafana dashboards checked into `deploy/`.
- k6 scenarios: steady ingest, burst, connection storm, reconnect storm, cold-cache stampede,
  pod-kill during load, and a hanging third-party endpoint (the bulkhead claim from Stage 6).
- **A written report** in `load/reports/` with method, hardware, numbers, and what was tuned.

**Done when:** the report exists with real p50/p95/p99 numbers against the targets, and any target
that was missed is explained rather than quietly dropped.

---

## Stage 8 — Public demo deployment

**Goal:** a URL a recruiter can open.

Deliverables:
- Deployment to a small managed cluster or a k3s VPS; TLS; seeded demo tenant.
- A demo page with the widget plus a public operator console with a throwaway login.
- README rewritten for the reviewer audience: what it is, the architecture in one diagram, the
  numbers from Stage 7, the ADR index, and an honest "what I would do differently" section.

**Done when:** a stranger with the link can hold a conversation with the operator console, and the
README answers "why" before they have to ask.

---

## Stage 9 — Prove the abstractions

**Goal:** the interview-winning demonstration that the ports are real.

Deliverables:
- `Ago.Platform.Messaging.Kafka` implementing the same port; the full suite green against it.
- `Ago.Chat.Infrastructure.MySql`; the full suite green against it.
- A short document listing every friction found (ordering scope, replay, `jsonb` vs `json`,
  `SKIP LOCKED` behaviour, offset/timestamp handling) — the honest list is the deliverable.

**Done when:** `Messaging:Provider` and `Persistence:Provider` switch the system with zero changes in
`Domain` or `Application`, proven by a CI matrix running both combinations.

---

## Stage 10 — AGO Chat: self-service, billing, and production readiness

**Goal:** turn AGO Chat from a seeded demo into a product a real customer can sign up for, pay for,
and depend on. Reprioritised ahead of Stage 11 (2026-08-23) — the author wants this before the second
product.

Deliverables:
- Self-service account/tenant registration, replacing `1-05`'s seed-script-only provisioning: a
  visitor becomes a paying (or free-tier) account holder with a first site and a first operator,
  without anyone running a script by hand.
- Account & billing management surface in `ago-console`: current tier, seats used, upgrade/downgrade.
- Entitlement enforcement matching the tiers and cost-containment criterion already decided in the
  private `ago-business` repo (seat count at minimum; attachments/history/site-count caps as those
  business decisions land) — DB-sourced checks, never cached, per `architecture/caching.md`'s "never
  cache what a write decision depends on."
- Subscription payment via ЮKassa: recurring/autopay billing, MIR-card-capable, checkout hosted by
  the provider so card data never touches AGO's own servers, payment-state confirmation via webhook
  through the existing outbox pattern (`architecture/messaging.md`) rather than trusting the
  redirect alone.

**Done when:** a real card can subscribe a self-registered account to a paid tier through ЮKassa,
entitlements enforce that tier's limits, and no part of the signup-to-paid-conversation flow still
depends on the seed script.

---

## Stage 11 — AGO Ads: the second product

**Goal:** prove the platform claim by building on it, not by asserting it.

Deliverables:
- `Ago.Ads.*` module: contextual ad serving through the same embedded script and ingest path.
- Impression/click ingest as a high-volume, low-value-per-event stream — deliberately a different
  load shape from chat, which is what makes it a real test of the platform.
- No edits to `Ago.Platform.*` beyond additive extension points; every one that *was* needed gets
  written down, because that list is the honest measure of how good the platform boundary was.

**Done when:** both products run in the same cluster from the same hosts, and the diff shows the
platform barely changed.

---

## Guardrails for all stages

- No stage is "done" with a red arch test, a skipped concurrency test, or a doc the code contradicts.
- Performance claims come from `load/`, never from intuition.
- Every stage that makes a real decision leaves an ADR behind.
- Scope creep goes to `docs/backlog/`, not into the current branch.
